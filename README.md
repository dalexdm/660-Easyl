CIS 660 Authoring Tool Project

To use the tool in its current state:
- compile the .cpp into a .mll file
- execute the MEL command "paintContext; setToolTo PaintContext1;"
- draw on any geometry in the scene. If no geometry is present, it will draw on a plane on (0,0,0) with a normal facing the camera
